## 🗂️ HDFS – Hadoop Distributed File System

HDFS is a foundational component of the **Hadoop ecosystem**, purpose-built to handle **large-scale datasets** across a **distributed environment**. Its architecture ensures:

- ⚙️ **High Scalability** – Easily expands across multiple nodes.
- 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance** – Automatically recovers from hardware failures.
- 🚀 **Efficiency for Big Data** – Optimized for storing and processing massive files.

Unlike traditional file systems, HDFS is tailored for **Big Data workloads**, where conventional storage methods fall short in performance and reliability.

 ### 📘 Key Terminologies

1. **FILE STSTEM &rarr;** A **file system** acts as a bridge between the **Operating System (Software)** and the **Hardware**, managing how data is stored and retrieved.


| Operating System | File System | Type         |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Linux            | EXT         | Local        |
| Windows          | NTFS        | Local        |
| Mac OS           | APFS        | Local        |
| Hadoop           | HDFS        | Distributed  |


2. **Process &rarr;** A particular PROGRAM in execution.

3. **Daemon Process &rarr;** A background process that runs without any user intervention.

4. **Metadata &rarr;** Data about the data.

5. **Replication &rarr;** Process of making **COPIES** of the data.

6. **Blocks &rarr;** Smallest unit of data storage in a File System.


## WHY HDFS?

- Distributed Data.
- Replicates the data stored.
- Efficient Access of data.
